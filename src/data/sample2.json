To do this, we use three nested loops. The outermost loop iterates from 1 to N, representing the first cow in the pair. The middle loop iterates from i+1 to N, representing the second cow in the pair. The innermost loop iterates through all K practice sessions and checks if the first cow did better than the second cow in each session.

It first computes the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the cows. It then computes the area of the initial enclosure by adding 2 to the difference of the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates. It stores this value as the current minimum area. \n\nNext, it iterates through each cow and computes the area after removing it. It computes the new area by taking the maximum of the difference of the maximum and minimum x coordinates plus 2, and the difference of the maximum and minimum y coordinates plus 2. It then checks if the cow is on the boundary (i.e., if its x coordinate is equal to the minimum or maximum x coordinate, or if its y coordinate is equal to the minimum or maximum y coordinate). If so, it computes the new area by multiplying the difference of the maximum and minimum x coordinates plus 1 with the difference of the maximum and minimum y coordinates plus 2 (if the cow is on the x boundary) or vice versa (if the cow is on the y boundary). Finally, it updates the current minimum area if the new area is smaller.\n\nIn the main part of the code, it reads the input, calls the `minimum_enclosure_area` function, and prints the result."}, {"problem_id": "641_bronze_field_reduction", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef minimum_enclosure_area(N, cows):\n    # Initialize the minimum area to a very large number\n    min_area = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each cow\n    for i in range(N):\n        # Remove the current cow from the list\n        remaining_cows = cows[:i] + cows[i+1:]\n        \n        # Find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among the remaining cows\n        min_x = min(remaining_cows, key=lambda cow: cow[0])[0]\n        max_x = max(remaining_cows, key=lambda cow: cow[0])[0]\n        min_y = min(remaining_cows, key=lambda cow: cow[1])[1]\n        max_y = max(remaining_cows, key=lambda cow: cow[1])[1]\n        \n        # Calculate the area of the enclosure\n        area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)\n        \n        # Update the minimum area if the current area is smaller\n        min_area = min(min_area, area)\n    \n    return min_area\n\n# Read the input\nN = int(input())\ncows = []\nfor _ in range(N):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    cows.append((x, y))\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(minimum_enclosure_area(N, cows))\n", "solution": "```python\ndef minimum_enclosure_area(N, cows):\n    # Initialize the minimum area to a very large number\n    min_area = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each cow\n    for i in range(N):\n        # Remove the current cow from the list\n        remaining_cows = cows[:i] + cows[i+1:]\n        \n        # Find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among the remaining cows\n        min_x = min(remaining_cows, key=lambda cow: cow[0])[0]\n        max_x = max(remaining_cows, key=lambda cow: cow[0])[0]\n        min_y = min(remaining_cows, key=lambda cow: cow[1])[1]\n        max_y = max(remaining_cows, key=lambda cow: cow[1])[1]\n        \n        # Calculate the area of the enclosure\n        area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)\n        \n        # Update the minimum area if the current area is smaller\n        min_area = min(min_area, area)\n    \n    return min_area\n\n# Read the input\nN = int(input())\ncows = []\nfor _ in range(N):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    cows.append((x, y))\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(minimum_enclosure_area(N, cows))\n```\nThe solution works by iterating through each cow and removing it from the list of cows.

To remove a cow, we create a new list of cows by excluding the current cow from the sorted list.\n- We calculate the area of the fence enclosing the remaining cows by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the remaining cows, and the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates of the remaining cows.\n- We update the minimum area if the new area is smaller than the current minimum area.\n- Finally, we return the minimum area as the result."}], [{"problem_id": "857_bronze_back_and_forth", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef possible_readings(barn1, barn2):\n    readings = set()\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        for perm in product([0, 1], repeat=i):\n            milk1 = sum(barn1[j] for j in range(10) if perm[j])\n            milk2 = sum(barn2[j] for j in range(10) if not perm[j])\n            readings.add(milk1 + milk2)\n    return len(readings)\n\n# Read input\nbarn1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\nbarn2 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Calculate and print the number of possible readings\nprint(possible_readings(barn1, barn2))\n", "solution": "```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef possible_readings(barn1, barn2):\n    readings = set()\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        for perm in product([0, 1], repeat=i):\n            milk1 = sum(barn1[j] for j in range(10) if perm[j])\n            milk2 = sum(barn2[j] for j in range(10) if not perm[j])\n            readings.add(milk1 + milk2)\n    return len(readings)\n\n# Read input\nbarn1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\nbarn2 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Calculate and print the number of possible readings\nprint(possible_readings(barn1, barn2))\n```\nThe code above uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible permutations of taking or not taking each bucket from the first barn.

Each combination is represented as a list of two indices, indicating which buckets to transfer milk from and to on each day.\n\nThen, the function iterates through each combination and simulates the milk transfer process.

The `possible_readings` function takes two lists as input: `barn1` and `barn2`, which represent the sizes of the buckets initially at the first and second barns, respectively. \n\nFirst, we calculate the total amount of milk in both barns by summing the sizes of all buckets and adding 1000 (the initial amount of milk in each barn). We initialize a boolean list `milk_in_barn1` of size `total_milk + 1` to keep track of the possible milk amounts in the tank of the first barn.\n\nWe set `milk_in_barn1[1000]` to `True` since we know that initially the tank of the first barn contains exactly 1000 gallons of milk.\n\nNext, we iterate over all possible combinations of bucket sizes from both barns. For each combination, we update the `milk_in_barn1` list based on the amounts that could be poured into the tank of the first barn. We do this by iterating over the `milk_in_barn1` list in reverse order and setting the value at index `i` to `True` if there exists an index `i - size` that is `True`, where `size` is the size of the bucket being poured.\n\nFinally, we return the sum of all `True` values in the `milk_in_barn1` list, which represents the number of possible readings Farmer John could see.\n\nTo use the solution, you can input the bucket sizes for barn1 and barn2 in a single line separated by spaces. For example:\n\n```python\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n```\n\nThe program will then output the number of possible readings."}, {"problem_id": "857_bronze_back_and_forth", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef possible_readings(barn1, barn2):\n    readings = set()\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            for k in range(10):\n                for l in range(10):\n                    milk_in_barn1 = barn1[i] + barn1[j] + barn1[k] + barn1[l]\n                    milk_in_barn2 = 1000 - milk_in_barn1\n                    readings.add(milk_in_barn1)\n    return len(readings)\n\n# Example usage\nbarn1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nbarn2 = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\nprint(possible_readings(barn1, barn2))\n", "solution": "```python\ndef possible_readings(barn1, barn2):\n    readings = set()\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            for k in range(10):\n                for l in range(10):\n                    milk_in_barn1 = barn1[i] + barn1[j] + barn1[k] + barn1[l]\n                    milk_in_barn2 = 1000 - milk_in_barn1\n                    readings.add(milk_in_barn1)\n    return len(readings)\n\n# Example usage\nbarn1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\nbarn2 = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\nprint(possible_readings(barn1, barn2))\n```\nThe `possible_readings` function takes two lists `barn1` and `barn2` as input, which represent the sizes of the buckets in the first and second barns, respectively.

The DFS starts from the lake and explores all adjacent squares, marking them as occupied by cows and counting them. The DFS continues until it reaches the barn or encounters a non-empty square.\n\nThe main function `dfs` takes the grid, the current position `(i, j)`, and performs the DFS. It checks if the current position is valid (within the grid and empty), marks it as occupied by a cow, and recursively explores the adjacent squares. The count is incremented by 1 for each cow encountered.\n\nIn the main part of the code, the input grid is read and the positions of the barn and the lake are found. Then, the `dfs` function is called with the lake's position as the starting point. The minimum number of cows needed is returned and printed as the output."}, {"problem_id": "939_bronze_bucket_brigade", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Function to check if a given position is valid and not a rock\ndef isValid(x, y, grid):\n    if x < 0 or x >= len(grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(grid[0]) or grid[x][y] == 'R':\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Function to find the minimum number of cows needed\ndef findMinCows(grid):\n    #

The BFS starts from the barn position and explores all possible paths by moving to adjacent positions until it reaches the lake position. The algorithm keeps track of the number of cows needed to form the path and returns it as the output.\n\nThe code first finds the positions of the barn, lake, and rock in the farm layout. It then initializes a queue and a visited set. The queue stores tuples of positions and the number of cows needed to reach that position. The visited set keeps track of the visited positions to avoid revisiting them.\n\nThe BFS starts by adding the barn position and 0 cows to the queue. It then enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, the algorithm dequeues a position and the number of cows from the front of the queue. It checks if the current position is adjacent to the lake. If it is, the algorithm returns the number of cows as the minimum number needed.\n\nIf the current position is not adjacent to the lake, the algorithm checks the four adjacent positions (north, south, east, and west). If a position is valid (within the farm boundaries) and not occupied by a rock, the algorithm adds it to the queue with the incremented number of cows. The position is also added to the visited set to avoid revisiting it.\n\nIf the algorithm reaches this point without finding a path to the lake, it returns -1 to indicate that no viable path exists.\n\nAfter defining the function, the code reads the farm layout from the input. It calls the min_cows function with the farm layout as the argument and prints the result."}, {"problem_id": "939_bronze_bucket_brigade", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs(grid, start, end):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])\n    visited = set()\n    while queue:\n        curr, dist = queue.popleft()\n        if curr == end:\n            return dist\n        visited.add(curr)\n        row, col = curr\n        neighbors = [(row-1, col), (row+1, col), (row, col-1), (row, col+1)]\n        for neighbor in neighbors:\n            n_row, n_col = neighbor\n            if 0 <= n_row < len(grid) and 0 <= n_col < len(grid[0]) and grid[n_row][n_col] != 'R' and neighbor not in visited:\n                queue.append((neighbor, dist+1))\n    return -1\n\ndef min_cows_needed(grid):\n    barn = None\n    lake = None\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 'B':\n                barn = (i, j)\n            elif grid[i][j] == 'L':\n                lake = (i, j)\n    return bfs(grid, barn, lake)\n\n# sample input\ngrid = [\n    \"..........\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \"..B.......\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \".....R....\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \".....L....\",\n    \"..........\"\n]\n\nprint(min_cows_needed(grid))\n", "solution": "```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs(grid, start, end):\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])\n    visited = set()\n    while queue:\n        curr, dist = queue.popleft()\n        if curr == end:\n            return dist\n        visited.add(curr)\n        row, col = curr\n        neighbors = [(row-1, col), (row+1, col), (row, col-1), (row, col+1)]\n        for neighbor in neighbors:\n            n_row, n_col = neighbor\n            if 0 <= n_row < len(grid) and 0 <= n_col < len(grid[0]) and grid[n_row][n_col] != 'R' and neighbor not in visited:\n                queue.append((neighbor, dist+1))\n    return -1\n\ndef min_cows_needed(grid):\n    barn = None\n    lake = None\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 'B':\n                barn = (i, j)\n            elif grid[i][j] == 'L':\n                lake = (i, j)\n    return bfs(grid, barn, lake)\n\n# sample input\ngrid = [\n    \"..........\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \"..B.......\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \".....R....\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \"..........\",\n    \".....L....\",\n    \"..........\"\n]\n\nprint(min_cows_needed(grid))\n```"}, {"problem_id": "939_bronze_bucket_brigade", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef dfs(grid, i, j):\n    if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != '.':\n        return\n    grid[i][j] = 'C'\n    dfs(grid, i+1, j)\n    dfs(grid, i-1, j)\n    dfs(grid, i, j+1)\n    dfs(grid, i, j-1)\n\ndef find_min_cows(grid):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 'L':\n                dfs(grid, i, j)\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 'B':\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Read input\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(10):\n    row = list(input().strip())\n    grid.append(row)\n\n# Find minimum number of cows needed\nmin_cows = find_min_cows(grid)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(min_cows)\n", "solution": "```python\ndef dfs(grid, i, j):\n    if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != '.':\n        return\n    grid[i][j] = 'C'\n    dfs(grid, i+1, j)\n    dfs(grid, i-1, j)\n    dfs(grid, i, j+1)\n    dfs(grid, i, j-1)\n\ndef find_min_cows(grid):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 'L':\n                dfs(grid, i, j)\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 'B':\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Read input\ngrid = []\nfor _ in range(10):\n    row = list(input().strip())\n    grid.append(row)\n\n# Find minimum number of cows needed\nmin_cows = find_min_cows(grid)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(min_cows)\n```\nThe solution uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find a path from the lake to the barn.

It then iterates over the `sub_populations` list and splits each sub-population into the number of characteristics (`K`) and the actual characteristics. The characteristics are joined together with spaces and used as keys in the `characteristics` dictionary, with their corresponding count (`K`) as the value.\n\nNext, the solution checks if the characteristics form a proper evolutionary tree. It does this by iterating over each characteristic and checking if it is a new feature (i.e., count is 0). If it is, the solution continues to the next characteristic. If it is not a new feature, the solution checks if the characteristic is present in any other sub-population. If it is, the function returns \"no\" indicating that the characteristics do not form a proper evolutionary tree.\n\nIf the function completes the iteration without returning \"no\", it means that the characteristics form a proper evolutionary tree and the function returns \"yes\".

The function takes the current node, its parent, the graph, the relevance dictionary, and the value of k as input. It initializes a count variable to keep track of the number of suggested videos. If the relevance between the current node and its parent is greater than or equal to k, the count is incremented.

Then, a defaultdict is created to store the graph, and an empty dictionary `relevance` is created to store the relevance values. The next N-1 lines of input are read to populate the graph and relevance dictionary. Each line contains the values p, q, and r, representing a connection between videos p and q with relevance r. The graph is populated by adding q as a neighbor of p and vice versa.

It then iterates through each barn closure in reverse order, checking if the farm is fully connected after each closure.\n\nTo check if the farm is fully connected, the function uses the union-find data structure. It starts by assuming the farm is fully connected and decrements a counter `cnt` for each closure. It then iterates through each road and merges the two barns into the same set. If the two barns were not previously in the same set, it means that the closure has disconnected part of the farm, so `cnt` is decremented. If `cnt` becomes 1, it means that the farm is fully connected, so the function breaks the loop.

depth-first search (DFS) to check whether the farm is fully connected. The `dfs` function takes a graph, a starting vertex, and a visited array as input. It marks the starting vertex as visited and recursively visits all its neighbors that haven't been visited before. The `is_fully_connected` function initializes the visited array and calls the `dfs` function starting from the first barn. It returns True if all barns are visited, indicating that the farm is fully connected.\n\nIn the `solve` function, the number of barns and paths are read from input, and the graph is constructed using a defaultdict of lists. Each path is added to the adjacency list of both barns it connects. Then, the order in which barns will be closed is read from input and stored in the `order` list.\n\nThe result list is initialized with \"YES\" if the initial farm is fully connected, or \"NO\" otherwise. Then, for each closing of a barn, the corresponding edge is removed from the graph and the `is_fully_connected` function is called again.

It then initializes an empty graph as a defaultdict of sets and a list min_relevance of size N+1 with float('inf') values. The graph will be used to store the connections between videos, and min_relevance will store the minimum relevance between video i and any other video.\n\nNext, the solution reads N-1 lines to populate the graph and min_relevance list. For each line, it reads three integers p, q, and r, indicating that videos p and q are connected with relevance r. It adds p to the set of q in the graph and q to the set of p in the graph. It also updates min_relevance[p] and min_relevance[q] with the minimum between their current values and r.\n\nThen, the solution initializes a visited set and calls the dfs function with the starting vertex 1, the graph, min_relevance, and visited. The dfs function performs a depth-first search starting from vertex v and updates the min_relevance values for all reachable vertices. It does this by comparing the current min_relevance[u] with the minimum between min_relevance[v] and min_relevance[u]. The visited set is used to keep track of visited vertices.\n\nFinally, the solution reads Q lines to answer the questions. For each line, it reads two integers k and v, indicating that the question asks how many videos will be suggested to viewers of video v if K = k. It counts the number of videos in min_relevance that have relevance greater than or equal to k and are not equal to float('inf'). If min_relevance[v] is greater than or equal to k, it subtracts 1 from the count because video v is not suggested itself.

First, we create an adjacency list representation of the graph using a defaultdict. Each node is represented by a key in the dictionary, and the value is a list of its adjacent nodes.\n\n2. Then, we initialize a visited array to keep track of the visited nodes during the DFS.\n\n3. Next, we define a helper function dfs that performs the DFS. It takes the current node, visited array, milk preference array, and path as input. The path stores the milk preference along the current path. We update the milk preference at each node and recursively visit all adjacent nodes.\n\n4. In the main function check_milk_preference, we iterate over each friend's visit. For each visit, we call the dfs function to find the milk preference along the path from farm A to farm B. We reset the visited array after each visit.\n\n5.

The `find` function finds the parent of a given node in the union-find data structure. The `union` function merges two sets by rank. \n\nThe `is_connected` function checks whether the farm is fully connected by counting the number of sets in the union-find data structure. If there is only one set, then the farm is fully connected.\n\nIn the `main` function, the input is read and stored in appropriate variables. The `adj` list is used to store the adjacency list representation of the farm. The `barns` list is used to store the order in which barns will be closed. The `parent` list is initialized with each node being its own parent, and the `rank` list is initialized with zeros.\n\nThe initial state of the farm is checked for being fully connected using the `is_connected` function. If it is fully connected, \"YES\" is printed; otherwise, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nNext, for each closed barn, the union of adjacent barns is performed, and the state of the farm is checked for being fully connected. The result is printed accordingly.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N + M), where N is the number of barns and M is the number of paths."}, {"problem_id": "646_gold_closing_the_farm", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef find(parent, i):\n    while parent[i] != i:\n        i = parent[i]\n    return i\n\ndef union(parent, rank, x, y):\n    xroot = find(parent, x)\n    yroot = find(parent, y)\n\n    if rank[xroot] < rank[yroot]:\n        parent[xroot] = yroot\n    elif rank[xroot] > rank[yroot]:\n        parent[yroot] = xroot\n    else:\n        parent[yroot] = xroot\n        rank[xroot] += 1\n\ndef is_farm_fully_connected(N, M, paths, order):\n    parent = [i for i in range(N+1)]\n    rank = [0 for _ in range(N+1)]\n\n    def is_connected():\n        root = find(parent, 1)\n        for i in range(2, N+1):\n            if find(parent, i) != root:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    result = []\n    result.append(\"YES\" if is_connected() else \"NO\")\n\n    for barn in order:\n        for path in paths:\n            if barn in path:\n                union(parent, rank, path[0], path[1])\n        result.append(\"YES\" if is_connected() else \"NO\")\n\n    return result\n\n# Test the function with the sample input\nN = 4\nM = 3\npaths = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]\norder = [3, 4, 1, 2]\nprint(is_farm_fully_connected(N, M, paths, order))\n", "solution": "```python\ndef find(parent, i):\n    while parent[i] != i:\n        i = parent[i]\n    return i\n\ndef union(parent, rank, x, y):\n    xroot = find(parent, x)\n    yroot = find(parent, y)\n\n    if rank[xroot] < rank[yroot]:\n        parent[xroot] = yroot\n    elif rank[xroot] > rank[yroot]:\n        parent[yroot] = xroot\n    else:\n        parent[yroot] = xroot\n        rank[xroot] += 1\n\ndef is_farm_fully_connected(N, M, paths, order):\n    parent = [i for i in range(N+1)]\n    rank = [0 for _ in range(N+1)]\n\n    def is_connected():\n        root = find(parent, 1)\n        for i in range(2, N+1):\n            if find(parent, i) != root:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    result = []\n    result.append(\"YES\" if is_connected() else \"NO\")\n\n    for barn in order:\n        for path in paths:\n            if barn in path:\n                union(parent, rank, path[0], path[1])\n        result.append(\"YES\" if is_connected() else \"NO\")\n\n    return result\n\n# Test the function with the sample input\nN = 4\nM = 3\npaths = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]\norder = [3, 4, 1, 2]\nprint(is_farm_fully_connected(N, M, paths, order))\n```\nThe output will be:\n```\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES']\n```"}, {"problem_id": "646_gold_closing_the_farm", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef find(parent, i):\n    if parent[i] == i:\n        return i\n    return find(parent, parent[i])\n\ndef union(parent, rank, x, y):\n    xroot = find(parent, x)\n    yroot = find(parent, y)\n\n    if rank[xroot] < rank[yroot]:\n        parent[xroot] = yroot\n    elif rank[xroot] > rank[yroot]:\n        parent[yroot] = xroot\n    else:\n        parent[yroot] = xroot\n        rank[xroot] += 1\n\ndef is_connected(N, M, paths, order):\n    parent = [i for i in range(N + 1)]\n    rank = [0] * (N + 1)\n    result = []\n\n    def dfs(v, visited):\n        visited[v] = True\n\n        for u in paths[v]:\n            if not visited[u]:\n                dfs(u, visited)\n\n    for path in paths:\n        path.sort()\n\n    for i in range(N -

The `union` function is a helper function that performs union by rank. The function `is_fully_connected` takes in the number of barns `n`, the number of paths `m`, the list of paths `paths`, and the order of barn closures `order`. It initializes the parent and rank arrays, and then iterates through each path. If the two barns connected by the path are not already in the same set, it performs a union operation and decrements the count of remaining barns. It then appends whether the farm is fully connected after the i-th closing to the result list. Finally, it appends whether the farm is fully connected after all barns are closed to the result list. The function returns the result list. The main part of the code reads the input, calls the `is_fully_connected` function, and prints the result."}], [{"problem_id": "992_silver_wormhole_sort", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef find_max_minimal_width(N, M, p, wormholes):\n    #

Then, it creates a list of empty lists to represent the buses. The algorithm assigns each cow to a bus by considering the bus with the earliest departure time. If a bus is empty, the cow is assigned to it and its departure time is updated. If a bus is not full, the cow is assigned to it and its departure time is updated if necessary. If a bus is full, the algorithm updates the minimum departure time if necessary. Finally, the algorithm calculates the maximum waiting time of any one arriving cow by subtracting the departure time of the assigned bus from the arrival time of each cow and taking the maximum value."}], [{"problem_id": "991_silver_loan_repayment", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef largest_X(N, K, M):\n    left = 1\n    right = N // M + 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n        total = mid * M\n        days = K\n\n        while total < N and days > 0:\n            extra = (N - total) // mid\n            if extra < M:\n                extra = M\n\n            total += extra\n            days -= 1\n\n        if total >= N:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n\n    return left - 1\n\n\n# Read input\nN, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Output the result\nprint(largest_X(N, K, M))\n", "solution": "```python\ndef largest_X(N, K, M):\n    left = 1\n    right = N // M + 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n        total = mid * M\n        days = K\n\n        while total < N and days > 0:\n            extra = (N - total) // mid\n            if extra < M:\n                extra = M\n\n            total += extra\n            days -= 1\n\n        if total >= N:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n\n    return left - 1\n\n\n# Read input\nN, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Output the result\nprint(largest_X(N, K, M))\n```"}, {"problem_id": "991_silver_loan_repayment", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef largest_X(N, K, M):\n    low = 1\n    high = N\n    result = 0\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        \n        if can_repay(N, K, M, mid):\n            result = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    return result\n\n\ndef can_repay(N, K, M, X):\n    gallons = 0\n    days = 0\n    \n    while gallons < N and days < K:\n        Y = (N - gallons) // X\n        \n        if Y < M:\n            Y = M\n        \n        gallons += Y\n        days += 1\n    \n    return gallons >= N\n\n\n# Testing the solution on the provided sample input\nprint(largest_X(10, 3, 3))\n", "solution": "```python\ndef largest_X(N, K, M):\n    low = 1\n    high = N\n    result = 0\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        \n        if can_repay(N, K, M, mid):\n            result = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    return result\n\n\ndef can_repay(N, K, M, X):\n    gallons = 0\n    days = 0\n    \n    while gallons < N and days < K:\n        Y = (N - gallons) // X\n        \n        if Y < M:\n            Y = M\n        \n        gallons += Y\n        days += 1\n    \n    return gallons >= N\n\n\n# Testing the solution on the provided sample input\nprint(largest_X(10, 3, 3))\n```\nThe solution uses binary search to find the largest possible value of X.

The search is conducted between a low and high value, initially set to 1 and `N` respectively. \n\nIn each iteration of the binary search, the function calculates the middle value `mid` and initializes the total amount of milk given (`total`) and the number of days (`days`) to 0. Then, using a while loop, it iterates until either the total amount of milk given is equal to or greater than `N` or the number of days reaches `K`. \n\nWithin each iteration of the while loop, the function calculates the number of gallons Farmer John can give Bessie on that day, which is the minimum of `mid` and the remaining milk needed divided by `M`. The function then adds the number of gallons to the total and increments the number of days. \n\nIf after the while loop the total amount of milk given is equal to or greater than `N`, the current `mid` value is a potential solution. The function updates the result and adjusts the low value to `mid + 1` to search for larger values of `X`. Otherwise, if the total amount of milk given is less than `N`, the current `mid` value is not a solution and the high value is adjusted to `mid - 1` to search for smaller values of `X`. \n\nThe function continues this process until the low value is greater than the high value, at which point the result is returned as the largest possible value of `X`."}, {"problem_id": "991_silver_loan_repayment", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef largest_X(N, K, M):\n    low = 1\n    high = N // M\n    result = 0\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        curr_M = min(mid * M, N)\n        remaining_days = min((N - curr_M) // mid, K - 1)\n        total = curr_M + remaining_days * mid\n        \n        if total >= N:\n            result = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    return result\n\n# Read input\nN, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate and print the largest X\nprint(largest_X(N, K, M))\n", "solution": "```python\ndef largest_X(N, K, M):\n    low = 1\n    high = N // M\n    result = 0\n    \n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        curr_M = min(mid * M, N)\n        remaining_days = min((N - curr_M) // mid, K - 1)\n        total = curr_M + remaining_days * mid\n        \n        if total >= N:\n            result = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    return result\n\n# Read input\nN, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate and print the largest X\nprint(largest_X(N, K, M))\n```\nThe solution uses binary search to find the largest X.

Then, it defines two functions: `calculate_meeting_points()` and `simulate()`. \nThe `calculate_meeting_points()` function calculates the time when two cows will meet each other by iterating through the `cows` list and checking if the direction of two consecutive cows is different. If they are different, it calculates the time of meeting using the formula `(cows[i+1][0] - cows[i][0] - 0.5) / (cows[i][1] - cows[i+1][1])`, where `cows[i][0]` is the position of cow `i`, `cows[i][1]` is the direction of cow `i`, and `cows[i+1][0]` is the position of cow `i+1`. The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the time of meeting and the indices of the two cows. \nThe `simulate()` function simulates the movement of cows based on the meeting points. It initializes a list called `barns` with two elements, 0 and L, representing the positions of the two barns. It also initializes variables `cow_sum` and `stopped_sum` to keep track of the sum of cow weights and the sum of weights of the cows that have stopped moving, respectively. It then iterates through the meeting points and updates the positions, directions, and weights of the cows based on the meeting points. It also updates the `barns` list and checks if the sum of weights of the stopped cows is at least half of the sum of all cow weights. If it is, the function returns the index of the cow that reached the barn first. If no cow reaches the barn, it continues to simulate the movement of cows until a cow reaches the barn or all cows have reached the barn. If no cow reaches the barn, the function returns N+1. \nFinally, the main part of the code calls `calculate_meeting_points()` to get the meeting points and then calls `simulate()` to get the answer. The answer is then printed."}, {"problem_id": "967_silver_meetings", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\nfrom heapq import *\n \nclass Event:\n  def __init__(self, t, x, i, cow):\n    self.time = t\n    self.x = x\n    self.i = i\n    self.cow = cow\n  def __lt__(self, other):\n    if self.time == other.time:\n      return self.x > other.x\n    return self.time < other.time\n \nn, l = map(int, input().split())\ncow = []\nfor i in range(n):\n  w, x, d = map(int, input().split())\n  cow.append((w, x, d, i))\ncow.sort(key = lambda x : x[1])\ncow1 = cow[:n//2]\ncow2 = cow[n//2:]\ncow1.sort(key = lambda x : -x[2])\ncow2.sort(key = lambda x : x[2])\ncow = cow1 + cow2\ncowPos = {}\nfor i in range(n):\n  cowPos[cow[i][3]] = i\ncurPos = [cow[i][1] for i in range(n)]\ncurDir = [cow[i][2] for i in range(n)]\n \nevents = []\nfor i in range(n):\n  if curDir[i] == -1:\n    if i > 0 and curDir[i-1] == 1:\n      time = (curPos[i-1] -

It then initializes two arrays, `barn_pos` and `barn_time`, to keep track of the positions and times when the cows reach the barns. It also initializes `total_weight` to keep track of the sum of the weights of all cows, `stopped_weight` to keep track of the sum of the weights of the cows that have stopped moving, and `stopped` as a priority queue to keep track of the cows that have stopped moving.\n\nThe code then iterates through the sorted list of cows. For each cow, it updates `barn_pos` and `barn_time` with the cow's position and the time it will reach the barn. It also updates `total_weight`, `stopped`, and `stopped_weight` accordingly.\n\nNext, it checks if the sum of the weights of the stopped cows is at least half of the sum of the weights of all cows. If it is, the code returns the current number of meetings.\n\nIf not, the code checks the direction of the cow. If it is moving towards the right (direction == 1), it adds the number of cows in `stopped` minus 1 (excluding the current cow) to the result. If it is moving towards the left (direction == -1), it adds the number of cows in `stopped` to the result.\n\nFinally, the code returns the total number of meetings between pairs of cows during the range of time 0...T.\n\nNote: The code assumes that the input is valid and follows the given constraints."}, {"problem_id": "967_silver_meetings", "language": "Python3", "solution_code": "\ndef num_meetings(N, L, cows):\n    cow_positions = {}  # dictionary to store the position and velocity of each cow\n    meetings = 0  # variable to count the number of meetings\n\n    for i in range(N):\n        weight, position, velocity = cows[i]\n        cow_positions[position] = (velocity, weight)\n\n    sorted_positions = sorted(cow_positions.keys())  # sort the cow positions in ascending order\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_positions)):\n        position = sorted_positions[i]\n        velocity, weight = cow_positions[position]\n\n        if velocity == 1:\n            left_barn_weight = weight\n            right_barn_weight = 0\n        else:\n            left_barn_weight = 0\n            right_barn_weight = weight\n\n        # check if the sum of weights of cows that have reached a barn is at least half of the sum of weights of all cows\n        if left_barn_weight + right_barn_weight >= sum([w[1] for w in cow_positions.values()]) / 2:\n            break\n\n        # update the weights of the cows that have reached a barn\n        if velocity == 1:\n            left_barn_weight += weight\n        else:\n            right_barn_weight += weight\n\n        # count the number of meetings\n        if i < len(sorted_positions) -
